    "# Snow Bear Fan Experience Analytics - Complete Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains all the SQL scripts from the Snow Bear quickstart, organized by section. Run each cell sequentially to set up the complete analytics platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Prerequisites - Complete BEFORE running this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the setup script**: Execute `setup.sql` first to create database, schemas, role, warehouse, and stage\n",
    "2. **Download required files**: Download `basketball_fan_survey_data.csv.gz` and `snow_bear.py` from the quickstart\n",
    "3. **Upload to stage**: Upload both files to the `snow_bear_data_stage` in Snowsight\n",
    "4. **Import this notebook**: Use Snowsight's \"Import .ipynb file\" feature to import this notebook\n",
    "5. **Cortex AI access**: Ensure you have SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER role (granted by setup script)\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Quick Setup Steps:**\n",
    "1. Execute `setup.sql` in a Snowflake worksheet\n",
    "2. Download `basketball_fan_survey_data.csv.gz` and `snow_bear.py`\n",
    "3. Navigate to Data → Databases → SNOW_BEAR_DB → ANALYTICS → Stages → SNOW_BEAR_DATA_STAGE\n",
    "4. Upload both files to the stage\n",
    "5. Download this notebook file and import it using Projects → Notebooks → Import .ipynb file\n",
    "6. Run this notebook!\n",
